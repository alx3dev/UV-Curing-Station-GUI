# A WORK-IN-PROGRESS

# Wireless-UV-Station
GUI for Wireless control of UV curing station driven by ESP-8266 / ESP-32

## Goals
 - Dead-simple and blazing-fast GUI for WiFi control of UV curing station for resin 3D prints
 - Work on Linux and Android devices (Windows is nice for a wider user audience, but it is a Fyne "side-effect")  
 - Some sensor readings (temperature, humidity...)  
 - Light and Dark themes that change without restart  
 - Multiple languages for navigation and settings that change without restart  
 - No direct control - works by sending commands to esp8266/esp32 firmware (so it continue to work after closing GUI)
